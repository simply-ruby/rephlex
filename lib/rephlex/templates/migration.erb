Sequel.migration do
  change do
    # Use Sequel DSL to define your migration operations here
    # For example:
    # create_table :users do
    #   primary_key :id
    #   String :name
    #   Integer :age
    #   DateTime :created_at
    #   DateTime :updated_at
    # end

    # add_column :table_name, :column_name, :data_type
    # drop_table :table_name
    # rename_table :old_name, :new_name
    # and more...

    # if change can not infer the reverse you can use up and down blocks:

    # up do
      # The operations to be performed when applying the migration
      # Use Sequel DSL to perform the necessary changes
    # end

    # down do
      # The operations to be performed when rolling back the migration
      # Use Sequel DSL to revert the changes made in the 'up' block
    # end
